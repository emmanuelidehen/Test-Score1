/*
 problem:
 Test Scores
 Write a program that dynamically allocates an array large enough to hold a user-defined
 number of test scores. Once all the scores are entered, the array should be passed to a
 function that sorts them in ascending order. Another function should be called that
 calculates the average score. The program should display the sorted list of scores and
 averages with appropriate headings. Use pointer notation rather than array notation
 whenever possible.
 Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for test scores.
 
 design:
 
 declare variables
 and dynamically allocate memory to the user which is stored in the heap
 crate function to get the users information and score
 create a function to calculate the average of the test score
 sort the scores
 create a function to ouput the information to the screeen
